This document is for adding fixed seed using `generate-seeds` script.


## Prerequisites
- Python3
- pip




## Install the [dnspython](https://github.com/rthalley/dnspython) package

`generate-seeds` script has dependencies on `dnspython` package.

```shell
$ pip install dnspython
```



## Add IP addresses

### Adding IP address to text file.

Add addresses to `contrib/seeds/nodes.main.txt` file located in bitcoin-ECC directory.
For example, Add `30.129.65.22:9777`

```shell
$ cd contrib/seeds
$ vi nodes.main.txt
```
Check `30.129.65.22:9777` is added.

```shell
$ cat nodes.main.txt
112.169.89.65:9777
112.169.30.29:9777
30.129.65.22:9777
```



### Execute script.

Execute `generate-seeds.py` script.  

```shell
$ python3 generate-seeds.py . > ../../src/chainparamsseeds.h
```

After executing, fixed seed is added to `chainparamsseeds.h`.


Check the result.

```shell
$ cat ../../src/chainparamsseeds.h
    
#ifndef BITCOIN_CHAINPARAMSSEEDS_H
#define BITCOIN_CHAINPARAMSSEEDS_H
/**
 * List of fixed seed nodes for the bitcoin network
 * AUTOGENERATED by contrib/seeds/generate-seeds.py
 *
 * Each line contains a 16-byte IPv6 address and a port.
 * IPv4 as well as onion addresses are wrapped inside an IPv6 address accordingly.

```

Compile source code again and check fixed seed is connected successfully.
